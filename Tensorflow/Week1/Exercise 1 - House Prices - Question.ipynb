You don't have to give the answer 400...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PUNO2E6SeURH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])\n","model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')\n","xs = np.array([50,  100, 150, 200, 250, 300,350,400,450,500], dtype=int)\n","ys = np.array([2500,10000,22500,40000,62500,90000,122500,160000,202500,250000], dtype=int)\n","model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)\n","print(model.predict([600]))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"a7RqMgF40u58","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])\n","model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')\n","xs = np.array([-1.0,  0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=float)\n","ys = np.array([-3.0, -1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0], dtype=float)\n","model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)\n","print(model.predict([10.0]))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
